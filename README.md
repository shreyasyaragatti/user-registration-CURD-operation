- **Read**: After submitting the form, the data is dynamically displayed in a table below the form.
- **Form Validation**: The form includes basic validation for required fields and formats (e.g., email format, phone number).
- **Reset**: Users can reset the form fields using the reset button.

## Technologies Used
